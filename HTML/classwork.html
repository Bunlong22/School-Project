        Early life
    </h2>
    <a>
        Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,
        [12] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, 
        a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, 
        who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is 
        of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral 
        Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily
        Italian ancestry.[5] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed 
        a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat√≠as, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[13] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence 
        as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[14] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother

        During the <inser>2003-04</inser> season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.
        [33] After being named player of the tournament in four international 
        pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with
        the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.
        [34][35] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. 
        He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.
